# Custom Compiler in C üõ†Ô∏è

## Overview

This project is a simple compiler built from scratch using the C programming language. It serves as a learning tool to explore the fundamental processes involved in compiling source code into executable programs.

## Features

* **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the input source code.
* **Parsing:** Analyzes the syntax of the code and builds an abstract syntax tree.
* **Semantic Analysis:** Checks for semantic correctness.
* **Code Generation:** Converts the parsed code into an intermediate representation or target code.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** C
* **Tools:** GCC, Makefile
* **Development Environment:** Linux/Unix-based systems

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arthurbric/Compiler_C.git
   cd custom-compiler
   ```

2. Compile the source code:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the compiler on a sample source file:

   ```bash
   ./compiler sample.c
   ```
